# This is a Machine Coding Problem where the input is a 2-Dimensional Matrix having 0 and 1's
# You have to draw a grid based on the number of 0 and 1's and handle the click state.




# Functional Requirement
1. Create an empty box where array value is 1.
2. User can select a box. Upon selection the box background color should change to #0bcc59.
3. Once all boxes are selected then the boxes should auto-deselect based on the order of selection.
4. Deselection should be non-interruptible as in once started, we can't stop it.
5. During de-selection, user should not be able to select a new box as in disable any box interaction.
