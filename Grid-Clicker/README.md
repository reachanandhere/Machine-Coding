# This is a Machine Coding Problem where the input is a 2-Dimensional Matrix having 0 and 1's
# You have to draw a grid based on the number of 0 and 1's and handle the click state.




# Functional Requirement
Create an empty box where array value is 1.
User can select a box. Upon selection the box background color should change to #0bcc59.
Once all boxes are selected then the boxes should auto-deselect based on the order of selection.
Deselection should be non-interruptible as in once started, we can't stop it.
During de-selection, user should not be able to select a new box as in disable any box interaction.
